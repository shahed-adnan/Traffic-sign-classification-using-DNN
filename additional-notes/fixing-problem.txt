1. 'No module found as cv2': There was an issue while installing opencv-python. It was related to path. However, I solved the issue
by running the following lines in notebook script.

import sys
    
!{sys.executable} -m pip install opencv-python

and then,
import cv2

was not creating anymore issue. Earlier it was showing 'No module found as cv2'
